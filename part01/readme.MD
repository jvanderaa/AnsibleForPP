# Getting to Know Ansible

These are the notes of finding more details and more information about pieces
that are discussed at a higher level.

## Slides

The slides are available in the outline.pdf file here. This is the deck used to
walk through. This being a automation focused contribution, all of the slide
decks used to walk through are maintained in source control here, and are of
format LaTeX.

## Inventory Files

To look at more detail working with inventory files, and look into some of the
more advanced plugins, head on over to the Ansible documentation page
[Working with Inventory](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_inventory.html).
